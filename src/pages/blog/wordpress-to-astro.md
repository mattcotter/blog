# Wordpress to Astro: Why?

I’ve been working with WordPress and other PHP-based content management systems for most of my career. My switch to JavaScript back in 2018 was a swift departure from what I was used to, and it came with a number of challenges.

Still, I made that change because I wanted to become a better developer. I felt like doing the same things over and over again would eventually box me in - or, maybe, typecast me (see what I did there?) - as just a “PHP developer.” Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but it wasn’t a label I wanted to wear forever.

## Finding My Happy Place

Ironically, working in JavaScript sometimes made me feel exactly how I was afraid I’d feel if I stuck with PHP. Aside from my experience at GE Aerospace, where I worked on their Auxiliary Design System, much of my time as a Vue developer felt more one-note than my PHP days ever did. I eventually found my place where I'm happier.

That said, I chose this path — and I do love working with JavaScript and constantly learning new things. It’s part of what makes this work so rewarding.

I had originally planned to build this site with Gatsby.js, but to my surprise, it seems like Gatsby has fallen out of favor.

So I built this platform with Astro — a modern static site generator that feels lightweight, fast, and developer-friendly. The community around it is active and welcoming, and I’m excited to share what I’ve learned as I explore more of what Astro can do.
